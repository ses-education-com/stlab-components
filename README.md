# STLAB shared components

This repository is created to solve the Bit.dev breaking version change that removed our components from accessible repos at bit.cloud and left us without shared components in 4 apps.

## Scripts

- `npm start` starts the react scripts app
- `npm run build` exports the components as parsed and minified script to /dist folder. Please, manually update semver version number in package.json after running this command with updated components' code
